Title: Submit your Salary
Date: 2016-12-10
Slug: hello-world

Hello and welcome to my first server-less side-project. This is a very simple site for submitting salaries and reviews.
What I hoped to accomplish with this was website with a very clean and minimal UI and something hassle-free on
on the back-end. If you have suggestions or comments please let me know by
<a href="mailto:info@submityoursalary.com">email</a> or <a href="https://tiwitter.com/salarysubmit">twitter</a>.

It was created with the following goals in mind:

* Allow users to submit reviews anonymously.
* Build in some rudimentary protection against spamming and malicious users.
* Keep the cost to host it as low as possible, static site, server-less.
* Minimal and simple front-end design, no heavy js frameworks.
* Make data-dumps public.
* And of course on the tech side of things play around with some new stuff I haven't played with before..
