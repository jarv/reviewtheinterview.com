Title: Review the Interview

Slug: hello-world


I've taken part in a few interviews recently and after some searching found that there weren't many quality sites for reviewing the interview experience.
For other candidates like me I'm curious how the process felt. Were you treated well or was it terrible? Did you feel like the company communicated well or were they dragging it along unnecessarily?
Lastly, and maybe the most important thing I would like to know before starting an interview is **were the interviewers interested in and invested in the process?**

The idea wasn't to create another massive interview and company review site like [glassdoor](https://glassdoor.com) or a site for sharing coding problems like
[career cup](https://careercup.com) or interview practice like [hacker rank](https://hackerrank.com) or [interviewing.io](https://interviewing.io). Rather it
was to see how much data I can collect with an emoji and free-form text and share.
So here we have [reviewtheinterview.com](https://reviewtheinterview.com) and the experiment begins...

It was created with the following goals in mind:

* Allow users to submit reviews anonymously.
* Build in some rudimentary protection against spamming and malicious users.
* Keep the cost to host it as low as possible, static site.
* Minimal and simple design.
* And of course on the tech side of things play around with some new stuff I haven't played with before..

I'll be writing a series of posts on the site if you are interested, subscribe to the blog or follow @interviewemoji on twitter.
