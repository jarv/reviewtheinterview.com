For other candidates like me I'm curious how the process felt. Were you treated well or was it terrible? Did you feel like the company communicated well or were they dragging it along unnecessarily?
Lastly, and maybe the most important thing I would like to know before starting an interview is &lt;strong&gt;were the interviewers invested in the process?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are review sites out there for companies and interviews and this is not meant to be as full featured or a place to get a lot of in-depth detail.
In my experience interviews are pretty different depending on the people in the loop.. What this site aims to do is capture the essense of an interview with an emoji and
free form text.  So here is &lt;a href="https://reviewtheinterview.com"&gt;reviewtheinterview.com&lt;/a&gt; and the experiment begins...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was created with the following goals in mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow users to submit reviews anonymously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build in some rudimentary protection against spamming and malicious users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep the cost to host it as low as possible, static site, server-less.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimal and simple front-end design, no heavy js frameworks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And of course on the tech side of things play around with some new stuff I haven't played with before..&lt;/li&gt;
