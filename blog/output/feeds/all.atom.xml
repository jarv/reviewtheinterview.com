This is a very simple site for submitting salaries and reviews.
What I hoped to accomplish with this was website with a very clean and minimal UI and something hassle-free on
on the back-end. If you have suggestions or comments please let me know by
&lt;a href="mailto:info@submityoursalary.com"&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://tiwitter.com/salarysubmit"&gt;twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was created with the following goals in mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow users to submit reviews anonymously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build in some rudimentary protection against spamming and malicious users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep the cost to host it as low as possible, static site, server-less.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimal and simple front-end design, no heavy js frameworks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make data-dumps public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And of course on the tech side of things play around with some new stuff I haven't played with before..&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
